◦ A real-time sign language recognition system to bridge the communication gap between deaf and those unfamiliar with sign language.
◦ Created a custom dataset with 3 distinct sign language actions: ”Thank You”, ”Hello” and ”Welcome”. Recorded 30 videos per action and utilized the Mediapipe holistic model for landmark detection.
◦ Built and trained an LSTM deep learning model for action classification, achieving 91% accuracy.
